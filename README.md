# SmashIT VR

## Introduction

Rage rooms offer an adrenaline-filled way for people to relieve stress, but they can also be costly, dangerous, and have restrictions on facilities and locations. To address these concerns, SmashIT VR provides a safe and immersive alternative. This virtual reality experience lets users relieve stress by ‘smashing’ a variety of virtual objects, simulating the thrill of a rage room without the associated hazards. The application offers users a wide range of hand-object and object-object interactions with immersive haptics and realistic breaking mechanics. It features 5 levels (including a tutorial), each presenting unique game objects to shatter, ensuring a diverse and engaging experience.
